# gfm

## 1. What is it

`gfm` is a simple file manager built in Go 

## 2. Getting Started

1. Install the lastest version of [Go](https://go.dev/dl/)  for your 'operating system'.
2. Run `go build gfm` to compile the code into an executable. 
3. Run `go install`, which installs `gfm` globally.

## 3. Current commands (adding more)
